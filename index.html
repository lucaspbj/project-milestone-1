                <h1>Welcome to Waterford, the oldest city in Ireland.</h1>
                <p>
                    Waterford is a city in County Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. It is located within the
                    province of Munster. The city is situated at the head of Waterford Harbour. It is the oldest and the
                    fifth most populous city in the Republic of Ireland. It is the ninth most populous settlement on the
                    island of Ireland. Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the city.
                    According to the 2022 census, 60,079 people live in the city, with a wider metropolitan population
                    of 82,963.

                    Stand on the quays in Waterford city, breathe in the salty air and it doesn’t take much to imagine the hustle of ships loading and unloading cargo in the 1700s. Trade with Newfoundland brought affluent merchants to settle here in the late 18th century turning the city into one of the great ports of Ireland and kickstarting a building boom. Take a stroll around the center of Waterford and you’ll see a host of beautiful architectural showpieces that date from this time. But to get the real picture, you need to cast your mind back further – to its founding by the Vikings in 914.
