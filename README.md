- **CSS Validation:** I've also validated my CSS code using the W3C CSS Validator. The stylesheet is compliant with CSS3 standards and doesn't have any errors or issues.

During the CSS validation process, a single error was identified. This error pertains to the inclusion of Font Awesome icons within the CSS file.
