## Browser Compatibility

I have tested my website on various browsers to ensure a consistent and optimal user experience across different platforms. The website is fully compatible with the following web browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Opera
- Microsoft Edge

During testing, I verified that the layout, responsiveness, and functionality of the website remain consistent and functional across these browsers. Users can access the site seamlessly using their preferred web browser.

## Code Validation

I've taken steps to ensure the quality and standards compliance of my website's HTML and CSS code. Here are the validation results:

- **HTML Validation:** I've validated my HTML code using the W3C HTML Validator. The code has been reviewed and conforms to the HTML5 standard without errors or warnings.

- **CSS Validation:** I've also validated my CSS code using the W3C CSS Validator. The stylesheet is compliant with CSS3 standards and doesn't have any errors or issues.

During the CSS validation process, a single error was identified. This error pertains to the inclusion of Font Awesome icons within the CSS file. However, it's important to note that this error can be safely disregarded, as Font Awesome icons are widely used and have been thoroughly tested for compatibility.

- **Accessibility:** I've taken accessibility seriously during the development of my website to ensure that it is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. Here are the steps I've taken:

## Bug Fix

I'm pleased to announce that a previously identified bug affecting Safari browsers with a width under 950px has been successfully resolved. 

An issue was identified where the text on the website was overlapping and overwriting the images. This bug caused the text content to appear on top of the images, making it difficult to read and impacting the overall visual presentation. The problem was particularly noticeable on Safari browsers with a screen width below 950 pixels. The text is now properly displayed, ensuring a clear and engaging browsing experience.


## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. **In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.**
   
2. **From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.**
   
3. **Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.**
